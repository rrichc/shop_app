This app was made through the completion of the course taught by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps).
 
## About the project
The premise of the project centers around a cross platform mobile app (Android & iOS) that allows customers to browse shop items, add them to cart, and place an order. It also allows shop owners to add new items to the store for customers to buy.
 
## Technologies Used
- Dart language
- Flutter SDK (Android & iOS)
- Firebase Realtime Database

## Learning Objectives Achieved
- State Management using the Provider pattern
- Screen/Route Navigation
- HTTP Requests
- User Authentication with Firebase
- Screen Animations

## What would I change in the future?
- Since the release of Flutter 2.0 (a year after this project was completed), a lot of screen nav functions have been deprecated. Given time and a desire to return to this project I would update the app with the latest routing features
- Change shop tile images to fit to box rather than crop
- Use ENV files for sensitive API keys instead of hardcoding them (a bit no-no that was not taught in the course) - The keys in this repo have been deactivated FYI ;)
